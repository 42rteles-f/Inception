Many daemon-based applications provide an option to run in the foreground, such as nginx -g 
'daemon off;' or mysqld --console.

 the first process launched in a container (often specified as the CMD or ENTRYPOINT) 
 runs with PID 1.

 # Good: (exec ensures the actual process replaces the shell)
CMD ["sh", "-c", "exec ./start.sh"]
docker run --init my-container

RUN rm -rf /var/cache/apk/*

Your volumes will be available in the /home/login/data folder of the
host machine using Docker. Of course, you have to replace the login
with yours.

To make things simpler, you have to configure your domain name so it points to your
local IP address.
This domain name must be login.42.fr. Again, you have to use your own login.
For example, if your login is wil, wil.42.fr will redirect to the IP address pointing to
wilâ€™s website

Your NGINX container must be the only entrypoint into your
infrastructure via the port 443 only, using the TLSv1.2 or TLSv1.3
protocol
